  <h2>Reasons I am Taking CS 110</h2>
  <p>I thought this class seemed really intresting, and basic literacy in technology is a increadably important skill anyone should have!</p>
  <p>But if we are making a actual list... I guess I could go more in detail.</p>
  <li>Class seems intersting</li> 
  <li>I needed another class</li>
  <li>Computer literacy is a usefull skill</li>
  <li>I enjoy challanging courses</li>
  <li>There was good feedback on rate my professor!</li>
  <p>To conclude there are many reasons why I chose this class, to many to explain in one webpage. So I will do my best to ace this class and learn as much as I can!</p>
